## *Too Long; Didn't Read?*

#### Going forward I will be adding a TL;DR section to all my academic writing and research papers. Think of it as a shorter, more colloquial counterpart to the research abstract. My goal is to make my work more accessible at a glance (believe me, my own attention span is not immune to the damage caused by overconsumption of short-form video content). That said, I strongly encourage you to at least skim, if not fully read, the complete piece:

1. Summaries are just that— summaries! If everything could be captured in a single paragraph, I wouldn’t spend 3,000+ words unpacking arguments, evidence, and nuance.
2. Context matters. Everything I write is through the lens of my own experiences, not untouched by biases, and a polished summary cannot fully reflect that. Reading the work in full empowers YOU to critique and question me (which you absolutely should!), and engage with the topic more deeply.
