Has [information overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload){target="_blank"} rendered you anxious and immobilized too? Thankfully, the absurd woman[^1] knows that '*Creating is living doubly.[^2]*' 

Creation transforms paralysis into movement. To create is to choose curiosity over consumption, to build rather than merely absorb. That is why I strive to examine, explore, enlarge, and enrich this ephemeral island on which I have just landed; my mission cannot be constrained to only one modern academic discipline. My thoughts—and consequently, my research—moves through psychology, culture, policy, literature, and the social sciences. Through learning and expression, I live freely.
