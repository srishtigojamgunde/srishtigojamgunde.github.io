    "text": "Introduction\nOriginally titled ‘Feeling Myself: Increased Occurrence Of Depersonalization/Derealization In A Highly Digitized Age Due To Alterations In Mind-Perception’. Conducted as a ‘Directed Studies in Psychology’ (PSYC 340E) project at the Brain And Reality (BAR) Lab, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver under the supervision of Dr. Farid Pazhoohi and Dr. Alan Kingstone. Submitted April 14, 2023.\nHave you ever wondered if there was a word for feeling like you were dreaming even when you were fully awake? Have you felt like an observer watching your own actions and mind at work? Chances are that this feeling resembles a more acute phenomenological experience called depersonalization. More precisely, it is a subjective experience characterized by a distinct feeling of disconnectedness from one’s sense of self (depersonalization), and/or from one’s surroundings (derealization) (Mellor, 1988; Sierra, M., & Berrios, G. E., 1998). Paradoxically, the subject feels stuck in one’s own mind yet somehow their own thoughts, experiences, actions and environment also begin to feel unfamiliar, out-of-control, and dream-like. (Ciaunica et al., 2021; Sierra et al., 2004). Extreme cases of depersonalization and derealization experiences (DP/DR, henceforth) can be indicative of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder (DPD) as recognised in the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2022), but experiencing DP/DR can be impairing and distressing for everyone so it is important to understand its causes and mechanisms.\nPast research has explored DP/DR through a variety of lenses and perspectives: Guralnik et al. (2000) identify the cognitive processes underlying DP/DR, namely deficits in encoding, memory and perceptual systems; researcher Anna Ciaunica has propounded alterations in self-awareness, consciousness, active inference, contributing a clouded sense of self in DP/DR (Ciaunica et al., 2021, 2022b); DP/DR has been identified as a trauma-response (Shilony and Grossman, 1993; Sierra et al., 2004) and many more. With advancements in technology in the 21st century, contemporary research has linked high digitization in our daily lives, and the consequent social isolation to increasing occurrences of DP/DR.\nCiaunica et al. (2022a) conducted an online study with 622 participants to understand how contextual factors, especially the Covid-19 pandemic, affect the occurrence of DP/DR. They found that digital activity (from video games to social e-meetings alike) positively correlated with feelings of DP as did more sedentary lifestyles. Furthermore, more experiences of depersonalization were correlated to increased vividness of negative (versus positive) emotions.\nPrevious research has also explored the associations between digital media usage and its impact on other behaviors like de-individuation, anonymity → cyberbullying, self-esteem, etc. (Chan et al., 2022; Super, 2005; Ozimek and Bierhoff, 2020). This brings us to interesting research on mind-perception: the extent to which we perceive others (objects, people, etc.) as having a mind, often characterized by the dimensions of ‘agency’ and ‘ability to experience’ (Gray et al., 2007; 2012). Recently, the research on mind perception addresses how recursive representations (e.g. a person vs a picture or drawing of a person) reduce one’s perception of others’ minds (Will et al., 2021). Mind perception is linked to a variety of social behaviors e.g.gaze cuing, prosocial behavior etc. (Gray et al., 2012). Thinking of DP/DR through the lens of self-perception as suggested by philosophers (Mellor, 1988) and then investigated by psychologists, we find a gap in research i.e. how digital media or recursive representations actually affect perception of one’s own mind and whether these differences in self-awareness/consciousness further relate to occurrence of DP/DR experiences. Simply put, if digital media usage and recursive representations of others cause decreased perceived ‘mind’ leading to harmful online behaviors and moral disengagement, does the same principle lead to a clouded sense of self/own mind perception, and consequently, DP/DR experiences?\nPerception of one’s own mind is very relevant to DP/DR since the former’s dimensions cover the main symptoms of the phenomena: feeling alienated from self and own actions (moral agency) and feeling disconnected from reality (moral patiency) (Sierra and Berrios, 2000; Gray et al., 2007). By understanding whether altered mind-perception (whether due to digital/social media use or not) links to DP/DR, we can aim to develop treatments for DP/DR that take into account this maladaptive/hampered awareness or perception of one’s own mind. In this paper, I will carry out preliminary research to explore whether the perception of one’s own mind, and mind-perception abilities in general, do indeed relate with frequency of DP/DR. To answer this question, I will conduct a study measuring participants’ state DP/DR symptoms, their mind-perception ratings on dimensions of agency and experience for various objects/people as well as themselves. In this correlational design, the predictor variable is mind-perception, and the outcome variable of interest is the state DP/DR of participants. The study will be online, presenting individuals with images of objects and people which is one abstraction level deeper than which we experience reality (Level 0). Since recursive representation has already been linked to decreases in mind-perception ratings (Will et al., 2021), we have avenues for future research by adding more levels of abstraction and considering whether mind-perception scores mediate DP/DR effects felt by the use of digital media.\nBased on the above-mentioned current understandings of the two concepts, I hypothesize that participants’ DP/DR scores would be negatively correlated to their mind-perception rating(on both agency and experience scales), and that this correlation will be especially significant between DP/DR and mind-perception ratings for one’s own self. In other words, the research hypothesis is that the lower the perception of others’/and own minds as having both agency and experiential ability, the higher the symptoms of DP/DR felt.",

    "text": "Methods\n\nDesign\nThe study uses a correlational design; the predictor variable is mind-perception, and the outcome variable is state DP/DR symptoms. The study was conducted using an online survey on Qualtrics software (version 2022 of Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA. https://www.qualtrics.com).\n\n\nSubjects\nA total of 445 undergraduate students (310 women, 129 men, and 6 self-identified as ‘other’), aged between 18 and 50 years (M = 20.22, SD = 3.17), from the University of British Columbia gave their written consent and participated in this study in exchange for course credit. A total of 288 participants (64.7%) reported being single, and 152 (34.1%) reported being in a relationship. Additionally, 4 participants reported being married, and 1 person reported being separated.\n\n\nMeasures\n\nMind Perception\nThe present study adopts the two-dimensional framework of mind-perception (Gray et al., 2007), which was the result of a large-scale survey collecting mind-perception data. Considering that this framework accounts for both the ‘moral agency’ and ’moral patiency’aspects of the perceived realness of minds, I operationalized mind-perception by ratings of perceived 1) agency (ability to do) and 2) experience (ability to feel) on a scale of 1 to 100 (Gray et al., 2007). If indeed the predictor and outcome variables are correlated, then, in line with the research hypothesis, I predict that participants experiencing DP/DR would attribute lower agency and experience to themselves, and to other objects and people as well.\n\n\nDP/DR\nTo measure DP/DR, all participants completed a modified version of the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS-29; Sierra and Berrios, 2000). The CDS-29 is a standardized questionnaire with 29 items measuring the frequency (from “never” to “all the time”) and duration (from “for a few seconds” to “more than a week”) of depersonalization or derealization experiences. The total score of a participant is calculated by summing all of the items. This questionnaire aims to gauge the severity of occurrence, however, the present study aimed to understand whether the participants felt any DP/DR symptoms whilst completing the online survey. Thus, the items were modified to a 7-point Likert scale for the same questions where participants rated whether they felt a particular symptom from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.” Each participant’s DP/DR score was calculated as an average of the Likert ratings for each item. This is a major limitation of the study as there has been no research to measure the validity of CDS-29 as a measure of state DP/DR and it is not even understood whether DP/DR can be felt and identified by a person as it is occurring in the present. However, the CDS-29 is the most sophisticated measure available yet for the phenomena with four sub-scales identified within it: ‘Anomalous Body Experience’, ‘Emotional Numbing’, ‘Anomalous Subjective Recall’, and ‘Alienation from Surroundings’ (Sierra et al., 2005).\n\n\n\nProcedure\nAs mentioned above, participants completed the survey online on Qualtrics software (version 2022 of Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA. https://www.qualtrics.com). Firstly, they filled out a consent form, followed by a demographics form. This was a within-subjects design as each participant was exposed to the CDS-29 DP/DR questionnaire first which included questions like ‘Parts of my body feel as though they don’t belong to me’ and ‘I feel as if I have no thoughts at all and that all my responses/reactions are being given by an ’automaton’ (Sierra and Berrios, 2000), and participants rated their agreement with these statements on a scale of 1 to 7 (strongly disagree to strongly agree). This was followed by 39 questions (adapted from Gray et al., 2007) rating given items’ agency and experience for mind-perception. Each question was also accompanied by a reminder about the definitions of Agency and Experience. (see Figure 1 for examples). Two questions in total measured the ratings of mind-perception for one’s own self.\n Figure 1: Examples of questions on the mind-perception scale (and accompanying reminder of definitions)",

    "text": "Results\nTo quantify the linear association between the two variables, a correlation analysis was done. DP/DR being an ordinal variable was quantified into 1-7 on a point scale, and mind-perception ratings were measured as continuous from 0-100. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to quantify this association.\n\nTable 1: Correlation Matrix\nThe average DP/DR score was \\(M = 2.76, \\; SD = 0.80\\). The average mind perception score was \\(M = 64.12, \\; SD = 9.36\\). As displayed in Table 1, DP/DR was negatively correlated with mind-perception, \\(r = -0.104, \\; p &lt; .05\\). Further, the relationship between DP/DR and mind-perception of one’s own self was significant, \\(r = -0.311, \\; p &lt; .001\\). This means that the lower one’s rating of mind perception (agency and experience), their state DP/DR experiences were significantly higher. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 2. Interestingly, the mode for the dataset of mind-perception scores for oneself is \\(100\\), though over 25 participants rated themselves \\(0\\) on both agency and experience dimensions. The average DP/DR score for the participants who rated their own agency and experience to be \\(0\\), was \\(3.08\\).\n Figure 2: Scatterplot depicting a linear association between mind-perception (self) and DP/DR.",

    "text": "Discussion\nIn this study, I explored whether there was a relationship between two concepts; mind-perception, and depersonalisation-derealisation. To this aim, this study measured people’s self-reported feelings of DP/DR, and mind-perception ratings across dimensions of agency and experience for various objects/people. Specifically, the ratings for people’s own perceived agency and experience were of interest. Altogether, the results indicated a negative correlation between mind-perception and DP/DR, and this relationship is especially significant for the ratings of own mind-perception and DP/DR. This is consistent with literature that has discussed the symptomology and dimensions of both phenomena respectively as discussed in the introduction; the dimensions of mind-perception seem to be closely aligned with symptom clusters identified for DP/DR especially the ‘Anomalous Body Experience’ and ‘Emotional Numbing’ CDS-29 subscales with the ‘agency’ dimension of mind-perception, and the ‘Alienation from Surroundings’ CDS-29 subscale with the ‘experience dimension of mind-perception.’ (Sierra et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2007).\nGiven that this correlational study was only a preliminary to research connecting these two concepts, there cannot be any causal conclusions drawn from it, although there are several new avenues for research that open up. One problem with correlational design, of course, is the third-variable problem in which recursive representations through the use of digital media might be causing both mind-perception and DP/DR to covary (Will et al., 2021). In fact, a number of other variables could possibly be involved in the mechanisms of DP/DR and mind-perception, but the association may still be used to predict and prevent the negative outcomes accompanying both phenomena. Future studies could study how mind-perception measures differ in various situations, for example, online survey, virtual reality, in lab, naturalistic environment etc. and whether these consequently affect occurrence of DP/DR. Additionally, a longitudinal study much like Ciaunica et al. (2022a) could study people’s lifestyle habits including digital media usage and how this affects people’s perception of their own mind, body, and surroundings.\nThere have been several treatments suggested to help diagnose or treat DP/DR (see Medford et al., 2005) and this study suggests that there are avenues to mending one’s own perception of mind, specifically fostering feelings of agency/the ability to do, and ability to experience/feel, as a clinical approach to DP/DR. Alternatively, changes in mind-perception may be due to dissociative phenomena like DP/DR (since we cannot draw causal links with just the current study) and could possibly be approached with cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness approaches (Medford et al., 2005; Hunter et al., 2014).\nFinally, a more rigorous measure of mind-perception of oneself may be utilized to study the mechanisms of DP/DR in future research especially considering that the current study only asks two items to measure this. There could be explorations of how perceiving others’ as lacking agency or experience i.e. lower ‘mind’ attribution, could be related to own agency and experience. In conclusion, this study provides a stepping point for research on DP/DR mechanisms with respect to mind-perception, especially that of oneself establishing a significantly negative correlation between the two as hypothesized. The results and implications are discussed, including avenues for future research in domains. After all, it is no wonder that understanding perceptions of oneself would be crucial to an acute phenomenon that is characterized by losing oneself, and one’s connection to one’s reality.",

    "text": "Abstract\nAs both older adults and the media assume a greater role in modern society, it is important to address ageism against older individuals and the role the media plays in exacerbating it. Children’s films and TV shows have often put forth negative and harmful depictions of older adults which can contribute to ageist attitudes from early on. A ray of hope: in recent years, the positive effects of nostalgia as a psychological mechanism have been highlighted, especially its potential to increase social connections and reduce prejudice. Thus, this paper, analyses how media—especially children’s media—can evoke interpersonal and inter-generational nostalgia among viewers which, along with its positive effects like aversion of death anxiety, increased social connectedness, continuity of self etc., can reduce ageist attitudes in society. I use Disney-Pixar’s film Up (2009) as a case study to evaluate the specific elements that can make a piece of media nostalgic. This exploration points towards several key elements as symbols of nostalgia in media: protagonists who are chronologically older in age, who have similar struggles, experiences, desires and values as the audience in a specific context etc. The extent to which this nostalgia can actually effectuate a change in people’s ageist attitudes and behaviors is discussed and finally, possible avenues for further research in how nostalgia can be utilized by filmmakers in practice to deter ageism and, at the same time, create commercially viable media.\nKeywords: nostalgia, ageism, media and film, Disney-Pixar’s Up, positive effects, IET",

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nAgeism is a prevalent and insidious form of prejudice characterized by negative stereotypes, apathy and discrimination toward older adults that can have a grave impact on their health and well-being. Different theories as to why ageism prevails have been posited; I argue that to address ageism from its roots, the explanation from the Terror Management Theory (TMT) is the most compelling. It states that growing older (and older age) is associated with increased mortality salience, so by stigmatizing older adults one can distance themselves from their future older self and inevitable mortality which alleviates death anxiety (Turner et al., 2017).\nRecent research such as Sedikides et al. (2008) identifies nostalgia as a potent mechanism for coping with mortality salience as it strengthens social bonds and imbues life with meaning. Consequently, I will examine nostalgia as a tool to tackle ageism through the means of media and popular culture. I discuss the immense potential of media and popular culture in reinforcing ageist attitudes and argue that reforming the media depictions of older adults are crucial to dismantling ageism from its roots. Next, I will present nostalgia as a promising solution to ageism, analyzing the film Up (2009) to explicate the key features of nostalgia that are effective to generate the desired nostalgia followed by an investigation of how this nostalgia can actually affect the behavior of the audience. I will, then, suggest future directions for research.",

    "section": "The Importance of Media",
    "text": "The Importance of Media\nFor the purposes of my research, ‘media’ will be used to refer to films and TV shows, the internet, advertisements, publications, and other forms of mass media. Media, then, is the largest cultural arena in which societal perceptions and attitudes towards individuals of various social groups are formed—including older adults. Several analyses have indicated that older adults have been consistently underrepresented or misrepresented in mainstream media, either setting unrealistic standards for older adults, or exaggerated mockeries which fuel ageist stereotypes. (Loos & Evans, 2018). For example, in Disney’s Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs (1937), 101 Dalmatians (1961) and Tangled (2010), the antagonists are all depicted as evil, old women who are obsessed with being young, beautiful and attractive. Ageism must be addressed where it starts—childhood, as research finds ageist attitudes even in young children which are, at least in part, socialized in them through such media (Isaacs & Bearison, 1986). Thus, this paper shall use another one of Disney’s childrens’ animated films: Up (2009) to exemplify how anti-ageist attitudes can be promoted by inducing nostalgia in the viewers. The film spans across the life of Carl Fredricksen, a 78-year-old who has lost his wife Ellie. In order to fulfill her dream, Carl flies his house to South America where he finds himself a new adventure. This film is chosen due to its commercial and critical success, how it arguably appeals to audiences of all ages and demographics, and most importantly because it acts as a prime example of media that generates mostly positive nostalgia.",

    "section": "Inducing Nostalgic Feelings Through Popular Media",
    "text": "Inducing Nostalgic Feelings Through Popular Media\n\nOlder Adults As The Protagonists\nThere is promising evidence supporting the effectiveness of nostalgia to reduce prejudice (Cheung et al., 2017). Nostalgia further emerged as a potentially effective method of combating ageism; Turner et al. (2017) empirically evidenced how nostalgia increased social connectedness which led to an increased Inclusion of Out-Group in the Self (IOGS) effectuating reduced ageist attitudes in young adults. However, not everyone can relate to the media such as to trigger nostalgia within them especially if that individual has had no prior positive experiences with older adults. Gaggioli et al. (2014) and Wildschut et al. (2018) offer a promising solution to this problem, demonstrating how nostalgic emotions can be transferred from older adults to younger adults through Interpersonal Emotion Transfer (IET) even when the nostalgic recollection is unrelated to the self. Furthermore, the ‘self’ is often a protagonist in nostalgic narratives. (Sedikides et al., 2008; Wildschut et al. 2006). These facts implicate that when seeking to remedy ageism through nostalgic media an important characteristic is an older character to be the protagonist—central to the nostalgic narrative. Up was the first Disney film to feature an older adult as a protagonist: 78-year-old Carl Fredicksen. Seeing older adults as the protagonists may additionally normalize their very existence in the audience’s mind and increase the self-esteem of older adults who may feel seen and represented in media.\n\n\n“You’re Not Alone”\nIET depends on the vividness, specificity, emotional empathy and universality of nostalgic themes as research indicates that several key themes run throughout nostalgic events (Wildschut et al., 2018). In Up, Carl is nostalgic for his childhood and the past that he spent with his wife, Ellie. Throughout the film he holds on to his house as it symbolized Ellie, even talking to the house as if it were her. But to make this nostalgic account more relatable, the famous ‘Married Life’ sequence depicts Carl’s life up to his old age which shows him falling in love, getting married, building the house with Ellie, attempting to have a child, struggling with infertility, domestic activities, financial troubles, growing old and finally experiencing the death of his beloved Ellie. This sequence is moving and nostalgic not only because it gives depth to Carl’s nostalgia which promotes IET as the audience reappraises their own surroundings in an emotionally congruent (i.e. nostalgic) manner (Wildschut et al., 2018), but also because it may make the audience nostalgic for their own past—their childhood, falling in love, memories with grandparents etc. Thus, media which depicts the older adult as not just nostalgic but also relatable may be more appealing and make older adults recipients of the positive effects of nostalgia like social connection and IOGS ultimately reducing ageist perceptions.\n\n\nNostalgia in a Context\nDey (2015) analysed how the nuanced representations of older individuals in Indian popular media generated a collective ‘nostalgia of values’ (i.e. for collectivist values: duty, responsibility, selflessness) promoting positive behavior toward older people. This principle can be applied to connect individuals to defining values within their culture that are closely-tied to identity, supporting the notion that nostalgia promotes continuity of the self (Sedikides et al, 2008). Thus, generating nostalgia for values which are characteristic of individualistic cultures by depicting them on-screen can serve a positive purpose; at the beginning of Up, Carl is unmotivated, frail, resistant to change and a ‘public menace’, but he soon emerges as an inventive, self-reliant, determined, adaptive and strong person (Individualistic values; e.g. Figures 1-4).\n\nEven Up’s elderly villain, Charles Muntz, has valuable individualistic traits; he survives in the wilderness all alone for years, and is remarkably determined. This further reinforces the idea that older individuals can have valuable characteristics. It can then be reasoned that when a viewer becomes nostalgic for these values that an older person depicts, it leads them to greater IOGS as the older person now resembles qualities that the viewer holds in high regard and were probably imbued in them at a young age.\nSince children’s films come with the assumption that families watch these movies together, the film itself can also become a symbol of nostalgia as viewers associate it with fond memories shared with loved ones. This along with the intergenerational nostalgia from the content of the media can decrease feelings of loneliness, and have a positive effect on the well-being and quality of life of older adults (Gaggioli et al., 2014).\n\n\nNostalgia from aesthetic\nNostalgia has many different kinds of triggers, one of which is sensory inputs (e.g. Reid et al., 2015; Barrett et al. 2010). The advantage of using media to generate nostalgia is that it can use sensory inputs such as the background score of the movie, the color palette etc. Up tactfully utilizes these film elements; Carl and Ellie’s house represents the 50’s ‘American Dream’, as the audience becomes nostalgic by witnessing their domestic life. There is a juxtaposition of this idealized past with the present where Carl is frequently exposed to diverse groups of people—indicative of modernization. He forms a positive relationship with Russell, the Asian-American child who accompanies Carl on his adventure, ensuring that the previously mentioned symbols of nostalgia promote a reflective (vs. restorative), future-oriented nostalgia.\nSimilarly, the background score in the ‘Married Life’ sequence is a jazzy-blues melody reminiscent of the 30s and 40s. This music is also employed several times throughout the film to convey that Carl was feeling nostalgic for his past especially when Carl looks through Ellie’s ‘Adventure Book’ and has an emotional, nostalgic realization motivating him to go and save Russell—imbuing his life with meaning. The music emphasizes Carl’s nostalgia which likely transfers to the audience. Hence, sensory and aesthetic elements can also serve as symbols of nostalgia with the caveat of promoting some of the negative effects of nostalgia if implemented without a compelling anti-ageist narrative to go with it.",

    "section": "From Reaction to Action",
    "text": "From Reaction to Action\nResearch indicates that nostalgia is often triggered by negative affect e.g. loneliness, aversion/avoidance, existential threat etc. (Stephan et al., 2014; Sedikides et al., 2008; Turner et al., 2017; Wildschut et al., 2006). Stephan et al. (2014) demonstrates how avoidance triggers nostalgia which consequently increases approach- increase in helping behavior, seeking proximity etc. This is important to understand how nostalgia can actually translate into meaningful action; the media can bring people’s worst perceptions about older people into the spotlight (induce avoidance) and make them confront their biases head on. Up achieves exactly this as Carl is introduced to the audience with all the negative stereotypes of old people such as him being grumpy, intolerant of the young (e.g. turning away Russell), weak (e.g. needing a walking cane, and being hard of hearing). Two nurses even make an ageist joke about Carl needing to use the bathroom “80 times a day”. But by the end of the film Carl is a strong, inventive, independent man with a purpose and meaningful social bonds. By subverting the characteristics associated with old age, the audience’s avoidance towards older people evolves into ‘approach motivation’ mediated through nostalgia and its associated positive effects.\nDocumentaries and films like Up, especially in an educational context, can appeal to auditory and visual learners, lead to increased awareness and reflection, critical thinking and active learning. (McCleary, 2013). This is why childrens’ films have a great potential in remedying ageism from its roots in early life media exposure. Childrens’ films also come with the assumption that parents and other adults like teachers will accompany children in viewing the film and their ageist attitudes can be reformed as well.",

    "section": "Conclusion and Future Directions",
    "text": "Conclusion and Future Directions\nIn this paper, I identified the key features of nostalgic media that would counter ageism in society; older adults being represented as relatable protagonists in a nostalgic narrative, contextual and aesthetic nostalgia, and moving the viewers to actively confront their internalized ageism. This exploration provide a guideline for future research to empirically test these features. Further research can also narrow down the scope of study to a specific form of media as the nature and audience of each medium are unique. This paper does not consider the negative repercussions of certain depictions of older adults in nostalgic narratives as recent research has found that collective nostalgia can actually increase outgroup exclusion (Sedikides & Wildschut, 2019). Therefore, the distinction between the objects of nostalgia which separate the older and younger generations must be discerned. Another limitation is that I only consider one case study which has two older male characters whereas many negative depictions of older adults even in Disney have been of women. It is necessary to consider sexism when we study ageism as they often co-occur.\nIn the 21st century, as older people assume greater proportion and roles in society due to advancements in healthcare, it is important that media not only avoid ageist representations of them but also take steps to remedy the harm that has already been done. Filmmakers have an added incentive to create such ‘nostalgic media’ as older populations’ growth also means that they are also a greater proportion of media consumers than ever before, contributing to commercial success—as was the case with Up. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that nostalgia can indeed be a potent tool to address social issues like ageism and that media can play a significant role in doing so (Turner et al., 2017; Gaggioli et al., 2014; Wildschut et al., 2018). Thus, nostalgia has proven itself to be more than just an escape to the past- that it has implications for the future and may hold the key to unraveling ageism by improving inter-generational relationships at the level of the individual.",
